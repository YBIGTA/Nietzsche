I'm friends with a lot of CS majors/grads. I DREAM of being a woman in STEM but I have severe math anxiety and I had to re-take college algebra because I failed it so hard the first time. Well now I have my degree in criminal justice and I just started my masters in interdisciplinary studies with a focus in conservation biology. But I don't love it. (It's a masters to get a masters, not actually anything useful) \n\nI am constantly feeling like everyone around me is gaining great success, getting these super useful and interesting degrees and job, while I'm over here as a fucking admin getting my masters in something I don't like because it's the only thing I can do. I told my mom, when I was a kid, that I never wanted to do what she did (admin work) and now here I am doing it and I hate it. I don't want this to be the rest of my life but I can't see any other options.
