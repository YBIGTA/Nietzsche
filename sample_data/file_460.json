BUT I want one that's slim fitting, ideally with slim-fitting arms, too (why do so many \"slim\" shirts have giant flappy arms?!). I'm 6', about 160lb and nothing like the beefy-armed models who usually model these things and make a regular fit shirt look like some sort of athletic compression garment. \n\nHas anyone found such a t-shirt? Logo-free 100% merino preferred, though not essential, and slightly heavier than the normal 150gsm material would also be preferred, purely for drape, flexibility and longevity. Any feedback on Wool &amp; Prince or WoolPro t-shirts? Outlier t-shirts look promising, but $110 is just silly money even for merino. My running shirts are from [PEP](http://www.pettetendurance.com/). \n\nIf such a thing doesn't exist, I guess I'll just get one tailored. \n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"onebag","subreddit_id":"t5_301sk","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Help me find a slim-fit merino t-shirt without sails for arms","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/6xavb7/help_me_find_a_slimfit_merino_tshirt_without/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
