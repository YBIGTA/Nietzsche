Would prefer full auto or burst(or both!) I do have a Nightlance epic that might replace it if the other one is better.\n\nThe Hydraulic I just pulled today was a Nailer. ( Was so disappointed by the choice. AR or Spear, I WANT BOTH GIMMEBOTH. I like spears.\n\nIt's stats:\n*-30% recoil\n\n*21% crit chance\n\n+45% Mag size\n\n*18% fire rate\n\n*60% mg size\n\n\nI mean, off the cuff it looks like a huge upgrade. And I really like the sound effect! But is the fire rate that noticeable? I haven't noticed much recoil anyway, so is that also a wasted stat?\n\nI would prefer not to waste too much XP on it if it does have crap rolls. I do prefer crit chance to crit damage, though both would obviously be better. Or at least until the weapon has 20-30% crit.\n\n\n\n**Basicly, I love the energy damage on my current weapon, but like auto a bit more. Is My Nailer worth upgrading to?**","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FORTnITE","subreddit_id":"t5_2t7hh","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"To use or not to use","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/6xavam/to_use_or_not_to_use/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
