From the versions of the Bran theory that I have read, and from what I have read about Bloodraven and the character portrayal on HBO, it seems more likely to me that Bloodraven was the one that told the Mad King to \"Burn them all.\" \n* Who came before Bloodraven as the 3EC/R? Who would've trained Bloodraven as the 3EC/R? It couldn't really be the CotF could it? If it were why didn't they train Bran instead of having Bloodraven do a half-assed job of it? Bran has been warned about spending too much time in the past, but who taught that lesson to Bloodraven?\n\nPlease forgive any formatting and grammatical errors, this is my second time posting/first time posting anything longer than 2-3 sentences.
