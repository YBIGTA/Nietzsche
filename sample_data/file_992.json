Im currently running a gtx 1060 and my FPS is unplayable, as it stays at 1-2fps and half the time, the terrain doesn't load in. This is the only game that i have this problem with as i also play overwatch consistently at 100fps. After an optimization update around 2 weeks ago, everything just went to shit. Anyone know a fix or a potential issue that i have?","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","subreddit_id":"t5_3fmbm","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Unplayable FPS issues","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6xavqi/unplayable_fps_issues/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
