I stumbled across the Alienware Alpha r2 and was intrigued because of the option to have an external graphics card, meaning that you could just upgrade the alpha if it started going obsolite (other than the ram which maxes out at 16gb, but from what I've heard, that's fine for a while longer). so I guess the big question on my mind that's keeping me from building a PC is the size. does anyone know of a case that would fit inside a suit case and could fit a full sized graphics card? or would I just be better off for my size desires just getting the alienware alpha and graphics amp?","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"buildapc","subreddit_id":"t5_2rnve","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"questioning whether or not I should build or buy","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6xavoh/questioning_whether_or_not_i_should_build_or_buy/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
