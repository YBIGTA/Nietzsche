It basically claims that the White Walkers are not the otherworldly (heh, Other) Ice-Monsters, but rather an unknown, unfairly demonized distinct culture. This theory's never really made all that much sense, given that we pretty much had that story already with the Wildlings, that the White Walker's purpose is to be a greater evil that wipes Westeros clean of unimportant, political bullshit, and that they've made absolutely zero attempts at diplomacy or negotiation. Their very first appearance in the prologue of the first book consists of slaughtering a village of Wildlings, attacking a trio of Watchmen, and laughing as they murder Waymar Royce. That doesn't seem like a misunderstood culture to me. If anything good's come out of the show, it's killing this theory in its crib. \n\nResubmitted because of mistagging.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"asoiaf","subreddit_id":"t5_2r2o9","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Spoilers Main] This theory's definitely dead, right?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6xavjj/spoilers_main_this_theorys_definitely_dead_right/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
