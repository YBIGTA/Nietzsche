Therefore, this month we will be banning the Top  20 most used countries:\n\n[Map](https://i.imgur.com/OAVDdNJ.png)\n\nFor those of you haven't had the luxury of a 1st-world education (looking at you, Americans) and can't read a map, here's a list:\n\n\n | | | \n---|---|---\nUSA | Germany | Poland\nFrance | UK | Russia\nCanada | Japan | China\nItaly | Sweden | India\nSwitzerland | Austria | Turkey\nBelgium | Vietnam | Netherlands\nSyria | Finland | Greece\n(We're aware there's 21 countries here, the few at the bottom were on equal footing)\n\nHopefully this month will bring the focus away from Trump/Brexit and Euro shenanigans, and we will see some more variety in our comics.\n\n---\n\n#Additional Rules\n\n* LKS will last until **00:00 GMT on the 1st of October**\n\n* All countries except the ones mentioned are allowed this month.\n\n* The ban extends to historical versions of the countries mentioned. This includes the USSR, Austria-Hungary, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Nazi Germany etc. If in doubt, ask the mods, and we will decide on a case-by-case basis.\n\n* Subdivisions and overseas territories of banned countries **can** be used, as long as they are not simply used as a stand-in for their parent country, and are treated as if they are a country in their own right.\n\n* No meta comics about the theme itself\n\n* Any rule-abiding comics that are removed this month as a result of LKS restrictions may be posted when the month is over.\n\n---\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask here in the comments or drop us a message.\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"polandball","subreddit_id":"t5_2sih3","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[Announcement] LKS - Lesser Known September!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/6xavky/announcement_lks_lesser_known_september/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
