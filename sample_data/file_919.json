Unfortunately due to real life scenarios I was forced to abandon a few games (wife went into false labor a couple times) and doing so tanked my behavior score. Right now I am 6193 and I'm having trouble climbing back up to my previous rank.\n\nIt's frustrating because the lower you go, the more players will report you for illegitimate reasons. I went from getting no reports at all and 10+ commends each behavior review to getting 2-5 reports and roughly the same amount of commends. I'm not sure how valve expects people to climb back up once they've taken a hit like that. I wish there was a more effective way to gauge toxicity levels.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Behavior score, and why the system is currently flawed.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6xavog/behavior_score_and_why_the_system_is_currently/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
