Some of you may not recognize me since I'm mostly inactive in the subreddit- however, believe it or not, I used to rank pretty highly on Plounge activity- we're talking top 5 at times IIRC. However, nowadays, I'm mostly seen in the Plounge Discord server, where, hey, I'm top 3 in activity overall. You should join there if you haven't already. If you're already there, tell me your username so I can recognize you more easily.\n\nI'll answer some basic questions first.\n\nName: I live in Texas and have a very southern name, so I'll let you guess- it's either Levi, Stetson, or Colt.\n\nAge: https://youtu.be/-DEwAZ0ozTs\n\nOkay, I'll tell you I'm not a minor [](/celestibrows) but that's all.\n\nWho's best pony: I flip flop around this a lot. Luna used to be my favorite. But with the past season Celestia has started to grow on me. Starlight is probably best main character pone. Trixie is solid too.\n\nGender: Yes please. Oh wait, I mean I'm a dude. \n\nHere's some general info. I live in Texas. I like pone. I'm about 5 feet and 11 and a quarter inches tall but we can round that up to 6 feet right? \n\nFun fact: I don't own and never have owned any pony merchandise. Never had a t-shirt or a plush. A sad and lonely existence.\n\nI'm gonna be a lawyer. I'LL SUE YOU. I like music. I have a diverse taste, I listen to most things. My most listened to genre is probably classic rock (Daft Punk is nice though). I don't listen to it so much but I quote rap songs often. \n\nOh yeah and look at [this thing here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/6rgd2i/plounge_ama_series_sign_up_post/) If you want to try for having the second best AMA.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MLPLounge","subreddit_id":"t5_2t403","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Ayy you nerds, I'm /u/Auctoritate and welcome to Jackass!
