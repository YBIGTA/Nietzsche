I am now more able to address the concerns of each patient and reach better solutions. I think that by making the NHS more efficient, we can keep it as a great resource for all. \n\nrealnyebevan said,\n\n&gt;As my username suggests, I'm very proud of our National Health Service. It has been an enormous asset to our country and to its people, and continues to give excellent results. However, more work must be done. We must strengthen the health service by focusing more on efficiency and evidence-based policy to meet problems right at the source. By spending sensibly but providing generous services, we've improved levels of care throughout the NHS. Only the Conservative government can guarantee a secure future for the NHS and stop it from reckless mismanagement. You can't trust the Greens and Radical Socialists to go to bat for the NHS by ensuring that it remains cost-effective and efficient.\n\nBevan then met with patients and others in the cafeteria and hospital beds.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MHoCCampaigning","subreddit_id":"t5_3ntyt","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"#GEVIII [Northumbria] realnyebevan visits NHS hospital","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MHoCCampaigning/comments/6xav1t/geviii_northumbria_realnyebevan_visits_nhs/","whitelist_status":null}
