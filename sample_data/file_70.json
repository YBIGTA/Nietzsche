Those who keep powerful militaries rule the Earth, and we are not one of those nations. For hopefully the final time, Leader Kennedy has decided to supercharge the military.\n\nFirstly, the Council granted his request to increase national subsidization of large industrial corporations such as Silicon Development and Radio Manufacturing. These subsidies will, of course, cost us, but will greatly increase our stocks of weaponry and vehicles. Additionally, many factories that were once used to create consumer goods and synthetic fuel will now be used to make guns.\n[Industrial Subsidies changed to High, 10 Factories changed to Military Goods]\n\nNext, in order to defend the homeland from any aerial bombings or attacks, a number of anti-air artillery will be produced. Quite a few of them will be fitted onto trucks for use in the Mojave, though the rest will be independently set up by engineers. [3900 H2 *Telescopes* and 750 V2 *Stargazers* recruited.]\n\nThen, the airforce will also be increased in size. 75 of our own H1 Eagles will be constructed. Also, using schematics for the Wilkinson Corporation's P-1A Peashooter, our engineers will design and build 150 P-1B Peashooters.\n\nFinally, the military will begin recruitment drives and propganda nationwide.
