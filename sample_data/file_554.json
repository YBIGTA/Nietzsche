Being able to set it to an arbitrary number of days (or even just a higher number than 3) would be good, but being able to set a maximum allowable cache size would be even better! I have lots of room on my phone, but don't always have good network connectivity or data available, so some options to tip the balance towards storage rather than redownloading would be much appreciated.\n\nThe ideal case would be to be able to set a maximum cache size (say 10GB) and once it's reached have the oldest untouched items removed from it. Since this might mean content would be stored for a very long time, the existing option to clear the cache would help maintain control over it.\n\nThanks so much!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"redditsync","subreddit_id":"t5_2tvpt","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"[REQUEST] More control over cache size and duration","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/6xavdv/request_more_control_over_cache_size_and_duration/","whitelist_status":null}
