I am currently in a situation where I need a cheap place to stay while I attend my fourth year of university. I am currently staying at a friend's house, and need to be out of here by Labour Day. I have responded to every reasonable Kijiji ad and have visited the poster boards near the main UW entrance, but am presently a little anxious due to the days I have remaining here and minimal response from ad posters.\n\nI have asked nearly all of my friends for a place to crash since July 2, and have been fortunate to maintain living spaces until now; however, I recently received my student loans and would actually like to use them to attend school and not skip a year, so if any of you have suggestions for places to look / inquire -- or if you are conveniently offering rooms for rent -- I would greatly appreciate a response.\n\nThank you!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Winnipeg","subreddit_id":"t5_2qtno","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Looking for a place to stay, Pt. 2 (Hi!
