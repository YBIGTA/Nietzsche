I've put some feelers out there through forums like DLF, but so far I've had \"minnows\" respond, and I'd prefer letting someone in with a little more experience.\n\n* Team is here: http://www57.myfantasyleague.com/2017/options?L=59599&amp;F=0017&amp;O=07\n\n* The league is a 32-team league with a double player pool. 1 QB, Points per carry, receptions and passing attempts/completions. IDP. \n\n* Dues would be $50, which would cover the rest of this year as well as half of next year. \n\nPM me if you are interested. Thanks everyone.
