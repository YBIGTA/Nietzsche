Just need someone with some solid art skills, or who has a program that could create a map. The map will need to have a tundra section, a desert, forest/woods, rainforest, islands, and small towns throughout. If you or anyone you know could help please reply, message, or email me at nerdydreadhead@gmail.com.\n\nThank You","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ComicBookCollabs","subreddit_id":"t5_2t6p2","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I Need Someone To Help Draw A Map!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ComicBookCollabs/comments/6xaved/i_need_someone_to_help_draw_a_map/","whitelist_status":null}
