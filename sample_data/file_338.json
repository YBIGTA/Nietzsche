This evening he was acting fussy, and right before bed I had DH check his temp (we have been checking all week and so far no fever). Three readings all said low fever (99.8-100.7). My worry is we don't know if it is going up or not, and we just put him to bed.\n\nWhat should we do? Just let him sleep? Wake him at some point to check his temp? He seemed so unlike himself and almost lethargic (but he doesn't nap well at daycare at all, so I thought he was just tired. But he did have an afternoon nap at home that was almost two hours...). He had goose bumps too.  I'm so worried. We gave him a dose of Tylenol before bed once we saw the low fever. Thanks for any advice. LO is 9.5 months.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"beyondthebump","subreddit_id":"t5_2u06v","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Put baby to bed with fever?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/6xav7m/put_baby_to_bed_with_fever/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
