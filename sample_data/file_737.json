Uncle sends back a question of do I like cooking? I told him that I like it a lot now that Nsis isn't here to hog the kitchen or to control how I cook (exact words). Uncle/Aunt/Grandma are the kind of people who are really nice but also believe in family a lot so I know that every time I bring up abuse mentions in conversations and remind them how deeply it is wrapped up in my nuclear family it makes them sad. It also annoys me because I've been telling them I'm a victim of abuse but they would rather not believe it even after Grandma saw *The Glass Castle*. I didn't draw comparisons with that movie and my life yet but I will if one of them wants to talk to me about being abused for the 5th time when they usually want me to give reasons for why I hate Nsis. \n\nI'm just sad at how much abuse has wrapped itself up in my life that even questions about cooking make me mention it.
