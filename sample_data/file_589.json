I was trying to move it to higher ground but there was a dip in the road and the water was deep. It flooded over my seats and I could smell something burning and my engine shut off. I was able to make it back to where I left it today and it smells god-awful but there is only water in the center console now. Would not turn on. Do you think it will be totaled? Trade-in value for my car is only around $15000.
