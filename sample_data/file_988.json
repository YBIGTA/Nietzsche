As of now though I'm in 100% boy mode, though I wear makeup and about 50% of the clothes I wear are women's that can pass as androgynous guy's clothes. \n\nI'm not sure though if having bangs in boy-mode will make me look very strange or not. I can't even find any pics on the internet of guys with long hair and bangs.   \n\nFor reference I have thin collar-bone length natural blonde wavy hair.  \n\nWhatcha think?","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"MtF","subreddit_id":"t5_2ub9j","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Can I get bangs with long hair while still in boy-mode?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/6xavqe/can_i_get_bangs_with_long_hair_while_still_in/","whitelist_status":"promo_specified"}
