I've seen people as an attacker and as a defender bust out windows or doors and be able to light up the entire spawn area before anyone can react. There shouldn't be a \"Well you should expect this to happen\" argument. It's toxic. Instead of taking away the ability to go outside as a defender, for the first 10 seconds of an actual match why don't we keep the outside blocked off, and when defenders get too close to a window or door it turns red with no visibility like in the prep phase. I'm saying this because it's to the point where spawn killing is ridiculous and it's going to turn away new players.
