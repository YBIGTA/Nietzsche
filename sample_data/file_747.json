With the way things are set up now, with everything being connected, a guy who loves grinding MyCareer could be the first to get to a 99, which will count as a legend. You essentially don't even have to be a Park player to become a Park legend. And it's not even necessarily a \"Park\" legend, you're just a legend, cuz getting to 99 doesn't require Park, you can become a legend many different ways in many different game modes. Gone are the days of being a \"MyPark\" legend, you'll just be a legend now. Maybe that's what immortalized meant in 2k17 for MyPark legends. Maybe they're the last \"MyPark\" legends. \n\nAnyway... things have changed.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"NBA2k","subreddit_id":"t5_2s84e","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A MyCareer Player Might Be The First MyPark Legend in 2K18","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/6xavjg/a_mycareer_player_might_be_the_first_mypark/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
