I see 1070s everywhere but some are EVGA, MSI, Nvidia ASUS ect ect. What is the difference?\n\n\nI see some 1070s have a bigger price tag, and the difference seems to be a matter of 2gbs or so. I didn't know video cards had storage or anything, what is that used for?\n\n\nLastly, will it physically fit? My mobo is a MS-7821 and I hear I need a proper 8pin cable, would I already have it if I have a GTX 770 running now?\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"buildapc","subreddit_id":"t5_2rnve","suggested_sort":"confidence","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"GPU upgrade, couple questions","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6xavi9/gpu_upgrade_couple_questions/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
