He said yes since he stopped riding a long time ago.\n\nI went to check and... well...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8S7oO3o.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/P2aLiIq.jpg\n\nNo one had touched it for over 30 years (the bike itself was over 40 years) and it hadn't been covered or protected in anyway so it was in pretty bad shape.\n\n\nI really wanted a faster bike... I ride every single day and long distances can be hard if your bike doesn't help you.\n\nI got to work and, after dissembling it, begun removing all the rust.\n\nEvery nut, every screw. One by one, every single part of that bike was meticulously cleaned.\n\n\nAfter spending a lot of hours (but not much money, luckily) on my new bike, I present it here to you, not to brag, but I hope it can be an inspiration for other in similar situations.\n\n\nMy pride and new travelling companion:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RZchjzu.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wqBDw6d.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X7MTI6Q.jpg","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"bicycling","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0s","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Old Bike to Fulfill an Old Dream","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/6xav65/old_bike_to_fulfill_an_old_dream/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
