We have drastically improved in central defence, central midfield and striker. \n\nDespite this I worry about the lack of goals in the team especially goals from midfield which is why I thought the Walker deal to be a key factor in us having a good season. Last season he scored 15 goals from the left in an average Hearts team and I think he would have had just as much of an impact for us.\n\nCeltic have so many players able to get them goals. In their team Dembele, Griffiths, Sinclair, Roberts, Mcgregor and Armstrong can be relied upon to consistently get goals and I believe thats the area where they are so far ahead of us. We have 1 player who will consistently get us goals and that is Morelos but he is still young and we can't put too much pressure on him.\n\nOverall I'd rate our business at 6.5-7/10 but us neglecting the wide areas is a big worry.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"rangersfc","subreddit_id":"t5_2sodi","suggested_sort":"new","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Thoughts on our overall transfer business?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rangersfc/comments/6xav64/thoughts_on_our_overall_transfer_business/","whitelist_status":null}
