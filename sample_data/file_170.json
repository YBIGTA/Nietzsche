Characters who have abilities that target other players (usually teamates) should be able to target themselves or have some other modification where they still get the benefit of the ability. Things like Ana being able to nano-boost herself, maybe Zarya's self-bubble having a shorter cool down since she can't bubble other people (...or let her bubble other people to get more power?), Zenyatta able to put his orb of harmony on himself. Maybe these changes aren't realistic; they're just some ideas I had. It'd be cool if some of the heavily teamwork-based heroes could also be somewhat viable in the 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1 context.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Overwatch","subreddit_id":"t5_2u5kl","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"FFA DM is great, but some ability changes would make it awesome","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6xav2q/ffa_dm_is_great_but_some_ability_changes_would/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
