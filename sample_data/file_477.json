Card background is a lot of competitive Yugioh, SV is my current favorite card game though. Been playing since DE. Climbed up to A rank pretty fast, then mostly played Take Two. Decided to buckle down and take this season more seriously.\n\n\nClimbed using Midrange Sword, Control Shadow, 2/3/7/8 Nep Nep, and Fast Dirt.\n\n\nPlaying Eachtar-less Shadow in this meta was surprisingly fun, because everyone expects you to drop him, only to be surprised by a Mordicai, Odile, or Nep. \n\n\nSame goes with Sword, since I rarely saw it played this season a lot of people didn't know how to deal with the midgame and how fast Sword can put up a field. Although I've been seeing more Aggro Sword decks the past few days in my climb. \n\n\nMy Dirt deck wasn't optimal, only having two Wizardess of Oz, so it was the least successful one I ran. Still a ton of fun though. \n\n\nMidrange Sword - i.imgur.com/WWLBlZ0.png\n\nControl Shadow - i.imgur.com/FOD4u66.png\n\n2/3/7/8 Nep Nep - i.imgur.com/Ns5HJ5F.png\n\nFast Dirt - i.imgur.com/6v4BEB4.png\n\n\nNow time to sit on my gold and vials until the next expansion lands. Also if anyone has been climbing well in Masters, I'd like to see your deck!
