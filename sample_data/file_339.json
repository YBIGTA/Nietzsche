I was expecting a fine powder, yet I ended up receiving VERY large crystals. I mean it honestly looks like big ole meth shards...\n\nEven though it didn't look anything like the picture posted on the vendor's site, I figured it was no big deal. I would just crush it up and snort it. No problem, right?\n\nWrong. Turns out, my DCK is REALLY HARD. I have tried everything from hitting it with a hammer to literally clamping it in my vice. I just can't get these shards to break.\n\nCan someone give me advice on what to do with my hard DCK? I'm at a loss.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"researchchemicals","subreddit_id":"t5_2rhqm","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Help- My DCK is really hard","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/6xav7n/help_my_dck_is_really_hard/","whitelist_status":"house_only"}
