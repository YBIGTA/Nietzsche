Or any big podcast in general? I know they're important, I'm not trying to put down the producers. I genuinely want to know what exactly they do for the podcasts. I assumed (for PMT, for instance) that Big Cat and PFT came up with most of the segments and ideas but they made it sound like Hank was way more creatively involved. \n\nI'm hoping for an answer from someone from Barstool but if anyone has any experience working on podcasts I'd like to hear from you too","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"barstoolsports","subreddit_id":"t5_2tgz6","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Producer's role in podcasts","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/barstoolsports/comments/6xavlz/producers_role_in_podcasts/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
