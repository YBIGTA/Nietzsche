When I started my corporate job, I could not find enough time to go to the gym or long runs like I used to, so I started to gain weight. Then, I was introduced to HIIT. The beauty of HIIT is that it is as effective as a traditional one hour workout, but is completed in much less time. You can also do it anywhere at anytime without equipment if you are running or doing bodyweight exercises. That is why I created the [Run HIIT Journal](https://dohiit.com/product/hiit-journal) and I hope I can help you on your journey with the journal and the free resources below! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**[The Run HIIT Journal](https://dohiit.com/product/hiit-journal)**\n\nThe Run HIIT Journal is for anyone who feels like they are too busy to workout for one hour, shower, eat, and get ready (all of which could take over 2 hours). You can finish a HIIT workout in 20 minutes or less. The journal combines high-intensity days (through running or bodyweight exercises) with low-intensity days (walking). and includes:\n\n* an introduction to the basic principles of HIIT\n* four weeks of running, bodyweight and walking exercises, and\n* a guide to build your own HIIT workouts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**[Questions and Free Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiit/)**\n\nI am also a moderator of r/HIIT where you can ask me questions and find a ton of free content including:\n\n* [Beginner's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiit/wiki/beginners_guide)\n* [Daily HIIT Workout of the Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIIT/)\n* [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiit/wiki/faq)\n* [Research](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiit/wiki/research)\n* [Workouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiit/wiki/workouts)","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":null,"suggested_sort":null,"third_party_trackers":[],"third_party_tracking":null,"third_party_tracking_2":null,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/f0NxuvcCWQw-auh_jlnf4RD-Enl5RJbwU-Cmpb-JboA.jpg","thumbnail_height":140,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Hey XXFitness!
