Anyone else hear back? \n\nStill many a slip twixt the cup and the lip here, as now I have to play the clearance game. Want to do that ASAP but it seems I can't begin my eQIP until I get emailed a code I am waiting on. Confusingly, in the email it states, \"If the Bureau of Diplomatic Security cannot finalize your clearance process by March 15, 2017 your background investigation will be discontinued and we will rescind our offer.\" However, the Security Clearance Initiation Instructions linked to in the email says, \"If your investigation is not completed in time, you will need to discuss with Student Programs any potential options, e.g., deferment to the following semester, later start date, etc.\"\n\nThese seems in opposition to each other. Anyone have any clarifying information on this? \n\nCongrats to everyone who was accepted.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"foreignservice","subreddit_id":"t5_2ud2t","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Department of State Spring 2018 Unpaid Internship","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/6xavhn/department_of_state_spring_2018_unpaid_internship/","whitelist_status":null}
