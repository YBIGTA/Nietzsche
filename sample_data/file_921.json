But after I got home from dinner WHAM.  Intense craving and general discomfort sets in.  Fuckin sucks man.\n\nI had a panic attack at the gym today that came on in the middle of a set of pull ups, so that was fun.  Almost passed out, considered asking the front desk for an ambulance but ended up walking around the gym in circles deep breathing for 15min like a straight weirdo.  On the way home the panic came back harder while I was driving on the highway.  Not good.\n\nI'm going to plow through this and be done with it.  Kratom use is so unbelievably irresponsible I can't even believe I fell into this trap.  I saw a post on here saying a batch tested positive for high levels of lead?  Not surprised.  Who knows what the hell we have been doing to our bodily systems, I know I've been wreaking havoc on mine because I've never felt so unstable in my life. \n\nHopefully this ends soon.\n\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"quittingkratom","subreddit_id":"t5_2xty7","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"48 hours in, no kratom.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/6xavoi/48_hours_in_no_kratom/","whitelist_status":null}
