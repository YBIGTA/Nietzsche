I haven't done any What If videos involving the Tellius Emblems because I was waiting on a good deal on two things.  I recently purchased a Wii HDMI adapter, and an Elgato HD60.  \n\nIf you have anything unusual about those games that you want to see in video form, please feel free to ask and I'll consider doing it. If you happen to have save file(s) near key locations in those games, I'd also appreciate it and even give you credit in video descriptions.  \n\nEdit: I got quite a few requests for these two games, so thank you all very much. I really enjoy hearing from you all, and while I cannot promise to fulfill every single request I get, I will do what I can to do several Telllius Emblem videos based on your suggestions today. I got my first major bump in subscribers by doing requests like these when Echoes was out, so words cannot express how thankful I am to still be able to do this two months later.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"fireemblem","subreddit_id":"t5_2t0cn","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Path of Radiance / Radiant Dawn What If Video Requests?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/6xav5f/path_of_radiance_radiant_dawn_what_if_video/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
