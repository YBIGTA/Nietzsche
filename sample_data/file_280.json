Apparently, due to the time it takes to process transfer credits this can delay your graduation. Ultimately I'm trying to find out whether a delayed graduation would also delay my ability to apply for a TN visa to work in the US. I'm planning to work in the US starting fall the year I graduate. \n\nExchange advisors gave some general info, so it would be great to hear from someone who did exchange in 4A/4B and/or worked in the US following graduation.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"uwaterloo","subreddit_id":"t5_2rb5s","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Exchange in 4A/4B: Will it delay graduation / ability to apply for TN?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6xav5z/exchange_in_4a4b_will_it_delay_graduation_ability/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
