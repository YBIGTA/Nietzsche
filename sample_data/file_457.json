Like Zoro drinks, Sanji smokes, Chopper drugs etc.\n\nThen I stuck. Because if I force myself to find bad habits of other ones, results will be feigned.\n\nSo I made a research and find some bad habits in Buddhism. I am not sure but they get along with Straw Hats. There are 10:\n\nRecklessness - Luffy (Always pick a quarrel)\n\nRestlessness - Usopp (His diseases)\n\nTorpor - Zoro (Sleeps at every opportunity)\n\nDelusion - Sanji (He thinks all women are innocent even if they are evil)\n\nGreed - Nami (Money issues)\n\nWrong Views - Chopper (Poisoned Hiluluk)\n\nDoubt - Robin (Always thinks bad things)\n\nConceit - Franky (Thinks he is suuuper!)\n\nShamelessness - Brook (Pantsu misete moratte yoroshii desu\ufeff ka)\n\nHate - ? (?)\n\nIf crew based on those things, the last nakama should be a hateful person.  But I don't know who will it be.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OnePiece","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfz5","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think 10th (and last) crew member will be hateful person","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/6xavb3/i_think_10th_and_last_crew_member_will_be_hateful/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"}
