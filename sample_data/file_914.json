This has a lot of people, including myself, confused. But after checking it again I think I understand. The \"Destiny 2\" store page that you can pre-order from contains the \"base game\" and \"pre-order content\" with the correct release date the 6th, meaning the items in the bundle a.k.a the full game and bonuses is unlocked then. I believe the \"base game\" having the release date of the 20th means that a seperate download for the base game will be released then, meaning you would've missed out on the bonus content. This could also mean you would get the bonus content if you purchase the pre-order version up to the 19th, giving you extra time to get the bonuses. This is just a guess as if it were an error, it likely would've been corrected by now. I could be completely wrong, however and it IS an error.
