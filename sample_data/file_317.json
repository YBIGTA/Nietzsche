We were sitting in a meeting and everyone was introducing themselves to me since I just started on Monday. The guy who interviewed me introduces himself and I look at him and say \"I know who you are! You interviewed me in November at the final round\". He replies \"no no we interviewed a bigger guy it definitely wasn't you\". I was pretty convinced it was me so we went back through the files and it turns out I was right. \n\nAnother colleague looks at me and says \"all your clothes look way too big on you, it's time to go shopping\". \n\nTHANK YOU LOSERS! I'm 17lbs from my goal and almost 43lbs down so far.
