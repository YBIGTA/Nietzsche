My hair is very thick and coarse (according to hairdresser). I have a good colorist who I see regularly for touch ups (roots only) and toner. Starting around March (if I remember correctly) the hair around my hairline in the front of my head is breaking off. I only wash my hair two-three times a week and only use a blow dryer maybe one-two times a week. Never use a straightener and occasionally I use a wand curler. I always use heat protectant. I only use shampoo for color treated hair. I don't wear my hair up or pulled back tightly. My hairdresser doesn't know what's causing the breakage in this one spot because literally the rest of my hair is damage free - she said it could be hormonal. Any ideas what is causing it or suggestions on how to stop it?
